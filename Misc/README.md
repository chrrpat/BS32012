Here is a description of the files found in this folder, and if necessary, how to use them. 

##File Descriptions

**deleting gaps** : This script was written by David Martin. It was used to delete error causing gaps in the text file genes.txt. I have saved it incase it comes in handy for other files.

**expression.txt**, **probes2.txt**, **genes2.txt** : All three of these files are outputs from previous versions of the parser. They either had indentation issues or missing values which made them not suitable for use in the production of the database. They can be viewed here to see how output of the parser evolved. 

**parsercont.py** : This is an early, not usable version of the parser. Again it is only present to show the development of the script.
