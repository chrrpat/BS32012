# BS32012

This repository will act as my lab book for the project module BS32012. 


The aim of the project is to develop a range of useful skills in bioinformatics, such as Python coding, database building, and the use of collaborative tools like GitHub.

In practical terms, the aim of the project is to extract data from a Gene Expression Omnibus dataset and insert this data into an SQL database. Python code will then be produced which will enable the user to query the database. A report will be produced based on the work seen in this repository.
