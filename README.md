# BS32012

This repository will act as my lab book for the project module BS32012. 


The aim of the project is to develop a range of useful skills in bioinformatics, such as Python coding, database building, and the use of collaborative tools like GitHub.

In practical terms, the aim of the project is to extract data from a Gene Expression Omnibus dataset and insert this data into an SQL database. Python code will then be produced which will enable the user to query the database. A report will be produced based on the work seen in this repository.
## File Descriptions

Here each file in the respository is described. If applicable, the use of the file will be explained. 

*README.md* : This is the file you are currently reading. It contains information about the respository and the files inside.

*GDS5088.txt* : This is the file which contains the experimental data which will sorted and placed into a database. The file contains information about gene expression at different stages of pregnancy in a number of different subjects. 

*MyParser.py* : This contains script for a parser which will open the above gene expression file, select appropriate information and write a new text file with the data tabulated. A template for this file was provided by David Martin which I completed. 

*deleting gaps* : This script was written by David Martin. It was used to delete error causing gaps in the text file genes.txt. I have saved it incase it comes in handy for other files.
